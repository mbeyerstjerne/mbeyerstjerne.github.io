<div style="font-size:90%; line-height:150%">

  This project looks at the complex task of computer-based classification of images, by means of a convolutional neural network. This was done as the final project for the course <a href="https://kurser.ku.dk/course/nfyk15002u">Applied Machine learning</a>, run by A. Prof. Troels Petersen (University of Copenhagen) between April and May of 2025.
