I was born on April 4th, 2000 (a Tuesday) in Sydney, Australia, where I was raised on the Northern Beaches.

### Facts about me:

- I own a piano, and try often to learn songs (by muscle memory, I'm not at all formally trained); Currently I'm focusing on Clair de Lune or 'Family' from the Super Mario Galaxy suite.
- I dabble in languages; I've spoken Danish since my childhood, I studied Japanese for 7 years in high school and university, I have 135K XP on DuoLingo after 2 years of learning French, I understand Norwegian and Swedish (and can pretend to speak it), and if I could instantly pick up a fourth language it would be one of Spanish, Italian, German, or Chinese.
- My favourite superhero is Scarlet Witch, although if I had superpowers I'd like either invisiblity or teleportation (both of which are extremely practical for everyday purposes).
- My LetterBoxd Top 4: <em>Casino Royale</em>, <em>Ratatouille</em>, <em>Interstellar</em>, and <em>Shrek 2</em>.
