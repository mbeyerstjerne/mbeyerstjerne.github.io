I was born on April 4th, 2000 (a Tuesday) in Sydney, Australia, where I was raised on the Northern Beaches.

### Facts about me:
- I own a piano, and try often to learn songs (by muscle memory, I'm not at all formally trained)--Currently I'm focusing on Clair de Lune or 'Family' from the Super Mario Galaxy suite.
- I have 135K XP on DuoLingo, after 2 years of learning French.
- I dabble in languages; My favourite writing system is Japanese, my favourite phonetics are French, and my favourite grammar system would be those of Chinese. I can understand Swedish, Norwegian, French and German, although I do not profess to be an expert in speaking any of those.
- Favourite superhero is Scarlet Witch, although if I had superpowers it would either be invisiblity or teleportation (both of which are extremely practical for everyday purposes).
- My LetterBoxd top 4: Casino Royale, Ratatouille, Interstellar, and I'm gonna have to get back regarding the 4th one.
