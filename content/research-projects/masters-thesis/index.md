##### Abstract

<div style="font-size:85%; line-height:150%">

In studying the evolution of galaxies, we observe a bimodality present in the galaxy population, distinguishing between two fundamental classes: younger galaxies with a high gas content and high star formation rates—referred to as star-forming galaxies—and older galaxies with less gas and low star formation rates, known as quenched galaxies. Understanding the mechanisms that halt star formation—commonly called galaxy quenching—is therefore vital for building an overall picture of galaxy evolution.

Recent observations using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have extended the discovery frontier of quenched, “red-and-dead” galaxies to much earlier in cosmic time than expected, back to when the Universe was less than 700 million years old. This breakthrough offers a timely opportunity to investigate how galaxy quenching occurs at high redshift, and how it differs from quenching in the present-day Universe.

This thesis will focus on studying mid- and far-infrared dust and gas properties of distant quenched galaxies, with the goal of understanding the impact of associated feedback mechanisms—such as those from active galactic nuclei (AGN)—on the cold interstellar medium. In doing so, we utilise publicly available ALMA and JWST data in order to investigate these properties. Specifically, this work will examine the retention of dust within distant quiescent galaxies, and analyse the likelihood of observing AGN activity within these systems. These analyses aim to provide an understanding of the dominant mechanism driving galaxy quenching in the early Universe.
