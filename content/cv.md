### Employment

#### Claims Handler

**DHL Insurance and Risk Management  | Kastrup, Copenhagen | Nov 2022 - Present**

- Managing complex cargo insurance claims from start to end, examining relevant documentation and consulting with business partners to determine liability, negotiating settlement terms with claimants to ensure cost-effective and satisfactory resolution.
- Performing ad-hoc queries upon using database tools as a claims tool superuser, extracting and analysing datasets in order to identify trends, and providing valuable insights to help shape future risk management policies.
- Analysing cargo claims data using Excel to identify trends in liability and settlement of claims, producing reports and visualisations to lend a data-based insight into decision-making processes within the claims management team.

### Research Experience

#### Student, NOT Summer School 2025

**Roque de los Muchachos Observatory | La Palma, Canary Islands | Aug 2025 - Oct 2025**

- Awarded limited opportunity to perform observations at the Nordic Optical Telescope.

#### Research Assistant

**University of New South Wales | Sydney, Australia | Jan 2023 - May 2023**

- Performed manipulations on galactic survey catalogue data using Python and TOPCAT, maintaining compilation tools used for extracting stellar stream data for a research group focused on galactic archaeology, in an effort to improve the accessibility of research data.

#### Experimental Project Work

**University of New South Wales | Sydney, Australia | Sep 2021 - Dec 2021**

- Constructed a nonlinear oscillator circuit and recorded time-series data to examine chaotic phenomena, performing analyses using Python to draw comparison to the relevant theoretical equations of motion, and producing visual interpretations of the system’s behaviour.
- Independently designed an experiment to determine the validity of the wave equation, utilising Fast-Fourier Transform analysis in Python to analyse measurements from a retrofitted guitar, and performing a final presentation of experimental findings.

#### Research Project Intern

**University of New South Wales | Sydney, Australia | Apr 2021 - Dec 2021**

- Analysed stellar spectra data from the GALAH DR3 galactic survey, using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to examine the chemical distribution of stars in the Milky Way, and to determine the rate of lithium destruction in red-clump stars.
- Compiled literature on relevant methods within galactic archaeology, adapting previous efforts to simulate stellar chemical abundances to develop a well-rounded research methodology, improving research comprehension and synthesis skills.
- Utilised Python’s Pandas and astropy packages, along with TOPCAT, to manipulate large tabular data, and applying pre-processing techniques when necessary to ensure reliability of subsequent analyses.
